 * 740. Delete and Earn
 * 
 * You are given an integer array nums.
 * You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:
 *   + Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. 
 *     Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
 * Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.
